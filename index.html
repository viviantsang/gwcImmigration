   <ol class = 'tips'>
        <li> Stay calm and do not run away </li>
       	<li> Remain silent, or tell the ICE agent that you want to remain silent. If you do speak, do not lie </li>
        <li> Ask to speak with a lawyer </li>
        <li> Do NOT sign any documents or answer questions without your lawyer present </li>
        <li> Record details and names of officers </li>
        <li> Expect delays in applications and renewal processes Immigration Services (USCIS)
              are crowded and could take about 3 years for a process. Even if you are applying for
      	 a green card renewal, you could still get deported. </li>
        <li> Getting a Citizenship card or having a green card ensures your status to stay
              and not getting deported. It is obtained by marriage after 3 years or less.

      	relatives to secure a legal status here as well.</li>
        <li>Keep copies of your current status applications They are notoriously famous for
              losing paperwork, so itâ€™s important to keep copies of applications or other important paperwork. </li>
        <li> Ask a US Congressperson for help Asking a congress person for help is very valuable,
              for they would most likely comply to answer questions for you.</li>
