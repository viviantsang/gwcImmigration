      <h3> About Us </h3>
      <div> <strong> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Who We Are:</strong> We, a group of five girls, are passionate about computer science and aim to make the world a better place through our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</div>
    <div> We are all high school students living in the bay area who feel a strong connection to our past.</div>
    <div> <strong> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Why We Are Doing This:</strong> Knowing the current political climate
      surrounding immigration, we wanted to create a reliable resource for immigrants.</div>
    <div> Each of us are here because someone in our past decided to come to America to create
      a brand new beginning for themselves and loved ones.</div> <div> This has inspired us to make people feel safe,
  or at least know a safe place.</div>
