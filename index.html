      <h3 class="mission"> Mission Statement </h3>
      <div class = "right transbox tips"> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is an agency that enforces laws surrounding border control, 
	trade, and immigration.<br><br> Under President Obama, the agency was only responsible for removing undocumented immigrants who had committed serious crimes. However, 
	under the Trump Administration, the agency has began identifying and removing all undocumented immigrants, even those with a clean criminal record. The number of people removed
	from the United States has increased dramatically since 2016 as a result of an increase in ICE raids. From these raids, children have been torn apart from their parents for months 
	at a time.<br><br><strong>We aim to make a difference by bringing awareness to this subject and inform those with minimal resources, also dealing with similar situations. The main 
	functionality of this website is the map we created, which identifies sanctuary cities, restaurants, and churches that have allied to protect immigrants from raiding. We hope that 
	families in danger of deportation and separation will be able to use our map and identify safe places that are “Safe to Stay.” </strong>

<!-- SECTION FOUR (TIPS/RIGHTS) -->
    <section id="section04" class="demo">
     <h3 class = "tiptitle"> Tips </h3>
     <div class ='disclaimer'> <center> Disclaimer: We are not professionals. Do not rely solely on these tips and rights. For the best help contact a lawyer. </center></div>
     <ol class = 'tips'>
        <li> Stay calm and do not run away. </li>
       	<li> Remain silent, or tell the ICE agent that you want to remain silent. If you do speak, do not lie. </li>
        <li> Ask to speak with a lawyer. </li>
        <li> Do NOT sign any documents or answer questions without your lawyer present. </li>
        <li> Record details and names of officers. </li>
        <li> Expect delays in applications and renewal processes. Immigration Services (USCIS)
              are crowded and could take about 3 years for a process. Even if you are applying for
      	 a green card renewal, you could still get deported. </li>
        <li> Getting a Citizenship card or having a green card ensures your status to stay
              and not getting deported. It is obtained by marriage after 3 years or less.
      	<li>Having one also guarantees your
      	relatives to secure a legal status here as well.</li>
        <li>Keep copies of your current status applications. They are notoriously famous for
              losing paperwork, so it’s important to keep copies of applications or other important paperwork. </li>
        <li> Ask a US Congress person for help Asking a congress person for help is very valuable,
              for they would most likely comply to answer questions for you.</li>
      </ol>
	<br><br>
      <h3 class = "kyr"> Know Your Rights</h3>
      <p class = "rights">
      <ol class = "tips">
	<li>Within 100 miles of the border, authorites are not required to get a warrant before stopping and searching anyone.</li>
	<li>Basic constitutional rights do not completely apply when it comes to the border.</li>
	<li>This zone is called the 100-mile border zone.</li>
	<li>Currently, immigration services are not allowing first-time DACA applications but renewal applications are accepted for those who currently have or previously had DACA.</li>
	<li>Agents can not stop and search you based only on your race, religion, origin, gender, or political beliefs.</li>
	<li>The First Amendment allows anyone to peacefully protest, although protests can easily become violent.</li>
	<li>For most cases, undocumented immigrants are allowed a hearing in court to remain in the United States.</li>
	<li>Undocumented children cannot be prevented from enrolling in public school.</li>
